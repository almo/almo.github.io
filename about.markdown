  With wide experience in R&D+i at Telecommunication and Software Engineering sector, 
  I have been always working developing, transferring and promoting innovative technologies. 
  Also I have been founder in a couple of non fully successful startups. 
  Starting on April 2013, I am glad to be part of Developer Relations team at Google.

  From an educational point of view, I have completed a master degree in Computer Science. 
  Nonetheless I have been keeping an eye on continuous education, with additional training 
  courses in project management, ITIL or entrepreneurship. Particularly I am extending my skills 
  on business & management, attending a part time bachelor in Business Administration.

  From a career point of view, I have been working in most of the stages of R&D+i, including 
  software development, project management (medium size projects), product definition, marketing 
  and business development at several R&D departments of Telecommunications and Software 
  Engineering industries. I always spent some time as associated professor in a Computer S
  cience School, teaching distributed operating system (Plan9, Inferno, Linux), embedded system & 
  robotic (BrickOS, ROS) and programing (ADA, C, Java, Limbo).

  During all this time, I have been focusing in open innovation strategies and planning and 
  deployment of innovation projects, deeply related with Open Source paradigms and technologies, 
  where developerâ€™s communities & 3rd parties play an important role. In particular, last five 
  years I have been designing strategies, aiming university students and SMEs, to engage d
  evelopers on new technologies.

  Geographically, as part of my activities I have been creating partnership with enterprises,   
  big industrial association, developers communities and universities in Spain, Argentina, 
  Colombia, Brazil, Mexico and Chile but also Canada, USA, Europe and Israel.

  Finally, I am a greedy reader, part time musician, runner, science fan and Linux Foundation, 
  ACM, IEEE and Computer Society member. Last but not least, in term of biological 
  achievements, I am married (so my selfish genes have won) and my wife and I have released three 
  new versions (one boy and two girls) of a new mixed and refurbished DNA."
